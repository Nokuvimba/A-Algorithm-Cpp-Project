# C++ Programming Project (A* Pathfinding)
**Name:** Nokuvimba Natalie Chiyaka  
**Language:** C++17  
**Project Title:** A* Algorithm (Console Grid Pathfinding)

## Project Overview
A console-based A* pathfinding program that finds the shortest path from **S** (start) to **G** (goal)
on a grid containing obstacles **#**. The shortest path is displayed using **\*** characters.

## Why C++17?
I chose C++17 because it supports modern C++ features (clean STL usage, safer patterns, easier code organisation)
while still meeting the requirement of C++11 or higher.  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/c-11-vs-c-14-vs-c-17/ 

## Current File Structure
- `main.cpp` – runs the demo map and calls the algorithm
- `Grid.h/.cpp` – grid storage + printing + helper functions (bounds, walkable, etc.)
- `AStar.h/.cpp` – A* algorithm implementation

## **What is A-Star Algorithm**
Read to understand the concept of the A*algorithm and looked and sample code :https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/a-search-algorithm/ , https://github.com/JDSherbert/A-Star-Pathfinding

### **Project Idea**

## Weekly Progress Log
### Week 1 (04/02/2026)
**Goal:** Understand A* and print a character-based grid.
- Researched A* concept + reviewed sample implementations.
- Created repo + Visual Studio project.
- Implemented basic grid printing using `vector<string>`.
- Implemented simple matrix printing as a warm-up exercise.
**SetUp**
created 3 files aAlgorithm.h, aAlgorithm.c, main.cpp

In lab 1 I worked on printing out a matrix in interger and string form:
