### **What is A-Star Algorithm**




### **Project Idea**


### **Week 1**
##### 04/02/2026
Read to understand the concept of the A*algorithm and looked and sample code :https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/a-search-algorithm/ , https://github.com/JDSherbert/A-Star-Pathfinding
and decided to use C++ 17 because it has cleaner utilities -researched from the link  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/c-11-vs-c-14-vs-c-17/ 

In lab 1 I worked on printing out a matrix in interger and string form:
